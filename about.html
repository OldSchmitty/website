                Hi, my name is Mark. I am an overly enthusiastic, and exceptionally passionate Computer Science Major living
                the Front Range area of Colorado. Naturally, living in such a beautiful mountain landscape, I love all
                things outdoors. Except I don’t. The view is nice, but I prefer a heated pool to a frigid mountain lake,
                and a nice evening on the couch with bad movies over a campfire in the woods. Really, who wants to have to
                set up a whole tent and campsite just to pack it all up in the next 48 hours? I like fishing though.
                Sometimes I even catch things.

                What I do really enjoy is everything nerdy. Sci-Fi/Fantasy stuff, comic books, video games, arcades, anime,
                anything mentioned in “Weird Al’s White and Nerdy”.  Just think of anything you can associate with the word
                nerd, or geek, or the phrase “3 Time Magic the Gathering: Game Day Champion”. Got a good picture in your
                head yet? Nice! Let me add a few things to really bring it into focus. I use to play Team Fortress 2
                semi-professionally (captain of Duck Soup Gaming). I currently play way too much DOTA 2.

                I have a collection of good Kung Fu movies. I have a collection of bad Kung Fu movies. I’ve watched nearly
                every episode of anything Gordon Ramsey has ever been in, and yet all I know how to cook is steak and
                chicken wings. I’m the kind of person that always does the math. The official strategy guide can say it’s
                more DPS, but I want to know for sure. We all make mistakes. One time I spent an entire day wondering why
                I couldn’t make a condition false in my code. That’s how I learned to look for semi-colons after conditions.
