                I'm an overly enthusiastic, and exceptionally passionate, hyper-nerd that is eager to apply my recent education to 
                develop quality software products. I'm known for being innovative, meticulous, and analytical in all of my pursuits. I'm a very competitive
                person. I have held top 100 mythic placements in Magic the Gathering: Arena multiple times in both limited and constructed. In paper Magic,
                I had frequent Pro Tour Qualifier top 8 finishes, and consistently held multiple byes at Grand Prix events. I also have won multiple Team Fortress 2 
                tournaments for highlander and vanilla formats. If that all sounds foreign to you, it just means a like to compete. I thrive on getting better at things.
                <br><br> 
                I enjoy reading and watching film in my freetime. I'm after a good story, no matter how it is told. I am a giant Marvel fan, including both comics and movies. 
                I read mostly Science fiction and Fantasy, with J.R.R. Tolkein and Neil Gaiman being my favorite authors. I enjoy all types of film. I have a soft spot in my 
                heart for bad movies. We wouldn't know quality cinema without them. I enjoy people greeting me with "Oh hi Mark" (The Room). 
                I am also a huge Dungeons and Dragons lover. No matter the RPG I am playing, you can be sure I am playing a Paladin.<br><br>
                This website is a personal project for me to showcase some of my development abilities as well as an outlet to expiriment with some new technologies and ideas.
                you may see things drastically change over time as I try new things.
