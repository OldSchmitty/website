                <strong>Once and Future King:</strong><br><br>
                Read this. Read it now. I will never take down this suggestion. Yes, it is flawed. Yes, it
                has terrible female representation. Yes, it has outdated opinions on chivalry. What it also has, are some
                of the most important moral discussions that still pertain to today, all disguised in a fantasy adventure about
                a boy who pulls sword from a stone. This book was heavily influenced by the events of World War II, and contemplates the ethics of
                warfare through the tales of King Arthur and his knights. Does might make right? The book is canonically Charles
                Xavior’s (X-Men) favorite novel. If it’s good enough to be a level 5 mutant's favorite, its good enough
                for you to read too. I guarantee it will let you see a new perspective on our world.<br>
                <br><br>
                <strong>Doctor Doom:</strong><br><br>
                I have been so excited for this ever since it was announced. As an adult, I find myself loving Dr.
                Doom more and more. I just can’t get enough of his arrogant confidence that meshes so well with his sense of duty and aspirations.
                You just know that when Doom says he will do something, he definitely is going to do it. This series features Doom as the anti-hero we
                all know he can be, as he struggles with his own identity, his past, and his inevitable destiny. We also get to
                see some nice lore explored, and possibly some answers to age old questions surrounding Doom’s connections to other
                 Marvel characters. You will also see other fan favorites such as Kang the Conqueror, and that pesky Reed Richards.<br>
                <br><br>
                <strong>Fahrenheit 451:</strong><br><br>
                I put this suggestion here because I feel like it keeps becoming more and more relevant to our world today.
                Based on a future where all books are banned, Firemen no longer put out fires, they start them. They burn any
                books or print media they find. Such things are far too dangerous. Guy Montag is one of these Fireman, and truly believes in
                his occupation until he meets Clarisse, an eccentric young woman who makes him question the world he lives in.
                This short novel is a great example of a literary work that serves as a warning for what our world can become,
                if we let it.<br>
                <br><br>
                <strong>Kingdom Come:</strong><br><br>
                A world altering event will occur. Many will die. Who is at fault? Norman McCray is tasked by The Spectre to
                witness events that will unfold in the future of our favorite DC super heroes. Norman must judge who is responsible
                for what is to come. After the advent of superheroes and the Justice League, super powered beings begin popping
                up at an exponential rate. It isn’t uncommon to run into multiple each day. While the number of powered
                heroes has increased to match the equal number of new villains, a problem lies in the new hero's morals.
                Most of them lack the convictions of the golden age Justice League members. One good deed can leave an
                entire city block devastated. Who will hold these new heroes accountable? As the rest of humanity watches
                the super population increase, unrest grows at their carelessness. Who can bring order back into the world?<br>
                <br><br>
                <strong>The Psychopath Test:</strong><br><br>
                Ronson tackles the heavy topic of Psychopathy in his notoriously hilarious style. How does a psychopath think?
                How does their brain work? He goes all the way from how the diagnosis began to modern day
                approaches. He also connects it to the media and cooperate world. Do we idolize the unique traits Psychopaths
                show in positions of leadership? When is madness entertaining, and when isn’t it? Ronson interviews multiple
                people from different walks of life with traits high in psychopathy, along with those who created the
                means of diagnosis in order to see how it is all connected in his witty style and unique perspective.
                Maybe, there is a little bit of a Psychopath in all of us?<br>

            <h1 id = "problems">Found Problem A? What About B?</h1>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;Recently I decided to add a new solid state drive to my computer. I had still been working off a Kingston 128GB
                SATA drive that was “good enough”. I am always very good about keeping my physical storage minimal, as well as keeping any
                important files in my cloud storage, but with new games becoming increasingly more demanding, I found myself
                constantly having to uninstall and reinstall each game as I wanted to play it. I decided to join the cool kids
                and finally get me a nice fancy M2 - NVME drive. I went all out and purchased the biggest and  fastest one I could find at
                Best Buy. Sure, I could have possibly found a better one online, but this was one of the frustrating moments
                where you just want to get it done now. I had games I wanted to play, and I wasn’t about to wait 2-5 days.<br>
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;The installation was easy enough. Remove the screw and heat shield, slide the drive in, and put back in the screw
                and heat shield. I reinstalled windows on my shiny new drive, migrated my old files, and updated all my drivers.
                I was up and running in under 30 minutes. My system booted in a blazingly fast 3 seconds. I had a whole terabyte of storage now. I
                could install whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. I had never felt so free. I opened up steam and fired up some games
                to see my load times. I never knew going from one solid state to another could improve my performance this much.
                And then my monitor went black…<br>
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;I was patient at first. Surely this was just my new GPU drivers adjusting. The screen remained black. After
                waiting what felt like an inappropriate amount of time, even for someone who is in denial that there is a
                problem, I started diagnosing. No response from the keyboard or mouse. She’s in a crash state. I rebooted and
                looked for error logs. Turns out my GPU had crashed and frozen the system. I found myself muttering what every
                IT person dreads to hear, “But it worked fine before”. Surely it had to be the GPU drivers. I cleanly removed
                them from the machine and reinstalled an older driver.  I launched my game again. I got into the main screen
                and pumped my first in triumph. I was clearly the best troubleshooter in the world, and fixed it on my first
                try! I loaded into a match much faster that my opponents. Now I could relax.
                And then the monitor went black…<br>
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;"Come on!" I pleaded to my non-sentient machine. I forced my computer to reboot and checked my logs again.
                Nothing. No errors. No clues to what was ruining my gaming experience. Time for the Blender (stress testing).
                I pull up my temperature and voltage monitors like a neuro-surgeon applying probes to a patient’s skull.
                I start with the GPU, the likely suspect. I start stressing it slowly, creeping up to 100% utilization,
                waiting for it do something wrong in a strange Man VS Machine staring contest. After about 20 minutes,
                I decide to go make dinner. After eating a clearly unhealthy amount of chicken wings, I check up on how
                things are going. No errors, GPU working like a champ. Okay, fine. I start up a new stress test aimed at
                my CPU and RAM. I crank up the intensity. And the monitor went black…<br>
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;Aha! I found you, you sneaky faulty piece of hardware! My RAM clearly caused the crash and raised a
                thousand errors on its way out. I breathe a sigh of relief, reassuring myself that I am still a troubleshooting
                genius. I open up my case and carefully inspect each module. After seeing no defects I spray out any dust that
                may have been I the slots and reinsert the memory sticks. I boot up into BIOS and reset the clock speeds and
                voltage settings (I had a slight overclock on them) to their defaults and boot again. This time when I started
                a match in my game no crashes happened. My team loss, but I was still relieved that everything was finally back to normal.
                I started an inner reflection of this moment as a good example of how we sometimes think we know what is wrong.
                Sometimes one problem unveils problems in other areas of our life we never knew we had. It’s good to always be
                diligent in looking for improvement.
                And my monitor went black…<br>
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;After pulling my hair out for a few more days, I learned a few things more. First, I had indeed already fixed my
                crashing problem and didn’t need to buy new RAM for my computer. Sometimes a new problem appears that mimics an
                old problem, but is actually something new. Second, sometimes things never go the way you expect. Third,
                apparently you can have a high enough framerate in a game that your HDMI cable can’t keep up and makes the
                screen go black. Use a display port cable when expecting frame rates over 120 fps with a 144 Hz monitor. My new
                ram has shiny LEDs now though, you know, for all those people that like looking inside my computer case.<br>

            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;Do you ever feel like you get way more into a thing than other people? Is it just me? I learned from an early
                age that I have a tendency to get overly excited by things. My parents called it “being hyper”. My classmates called
                it “being a nerd”. I called it “being the only person that truly understands how great this thing is and I
                desperately need you to know about it too”. When I was in elementary school, George Lucas had done the unthinkable.
                He made a news Star Wars movie, Episode 1: The Phantom Menace. I was 10 years old and can vividly remember seeing the
                trailer in the movie theater. I screamed out loud “MOM... IT’S A NEW STAR WARS MOVIE... LOOK”! I was grounded
                when we got home. I couldn’t stop talking to my family about the Star Wars trailer during the movie. I don’t even
                remember what movie we saw that day. It doesn’t matter. It wasn’t Star Wars.<br>
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;My grandpa decided to have some family movie nights when I was very young, usually involving movies in a series.
                One fateful day he loaded Star Wars into the VCR and told me "I think you are going to really like this one Mark".
                He was oh so right. I was completely enraptured by them. I kept asking to watch them again and again. I asked him so much,
                my grandfather bought my family the original collector’s editions with all of the extended features. I
                watched Star Wars at least twice a week. I read every Star Wars novel my school library had. All 8 of them.
                Twice. I was a self-certified Star Wars expert. the only thing I didn't like about Star Wars, was that I
                would never be able to see a new one. Little did I know, things were about to change.<br>
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;George Lucas had given me what I never thought I could have, the ability to watch a new Star Wars
                movie in theaters! As much as I liked Star Wars before, it was nothing compared to my newfound excitement.
                Every thought of every day was about Star Wars. I got in trouble at my school the week after I had seen
                the trailer. Instead of focusing on my assignments I kept daydreaming about the new movie. I managed to get a copy of
                the special Star Wars Popular Mechanics issue, where it showed off all of the new technology and space ships what would
                be featured in the film. I snuck it into my backpack and tried to steal glimpses of it during my classes,
                inevitably leading to it being taken away multiple times. I remember my teacher asking me one recess, “Why
                aren’t you playing with your friend Timothy?” My reply was simple, “Because he won’t talk about Star Wars with
                me anymore”.<br>
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;When the movie came out, I remember my mother having to tell me that I could not bring my Luke Skywalker light
                saber toy with me to the theater. Nor could I bring any of my other toys, or my Star Wars Trivia books. How was
                anyone supposed to know how much of a fan I was, or how long I had been waiting for this movie to come out? Once
                those giant yellow credits started rolling though, I didn’t care anymore. I was here, and it was finally happening.
                My little mind was blown away at what I saw. A main protagonist my age! Pod racing! New Jedi! It was everything I
                had hoped for, and the best part yet, there were going to be 2 more movies coming too! I begged my mother to take
                me to see it again and again. Turns out other boys were going to see it as part of their birthday parties. So much
                for “We aren’t going to see that again, I already took you 3 times” Mom. I got to see it 7 more times with friends,
                so take that.<br>
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;Okay, so maybe my love of Star Wars isn't what some would consider “healthy”, but I think there is something
                positive to be said for finding those things in life that take you to these places of near obsession.
                On the plus side, people Like me are super easy to buy gifts for. What kind of things does Mark like?
                Well, my Christmas lists as a child usually consisted of 1 or 2 themes rather than a list of items.
                (Thanks for the Infinity Gauntlet oven glove and Mjolnir bottle opener friends, I love them.)
                Aside from being predictable, I think it’s important that people have something that really sets a fire inside
                them. Something that feels so important to them that they feel obligated to share it with everyone around
                them because they truly believe it will make their lives that much better. If you haven’t ever liked
                something so much that those closest to you are sick and tired of hearing it, I challenge you to find
                that thing. It’s worth it. Even if people look at you crazily as you dress up as a Jedi for the premier.
                Even if squeal like child because you finally get to see Boba Fett taking names like he did in
                your childhood novels and people question your “maturity” (thank you Dave Filoni and Jon Favreeau The Mandalorian).<br>
