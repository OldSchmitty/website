                    Hello, my name is Mark.<br>
                    As a recent graduate in Computer Science, I am excited to launch into a
                    Software Engineer role. My past experience includes retail management, customer service, system administration, computer repair, and data analysis. I enjoy tackling challenging problems and improving business processes.

                I am a natural-born innovator, always looking for ways to improve. In all my previous positions, 
                I have been able to identify bottlenecks and implement technical solutions to improve business success.

                <br>
                One stop soultion for computer problems. I do diagnosis, repair, custom builds, and everything in-between. I thrive on solving problems others don't want to tackle. 
                Say it can't be done, and I will find a way.
            </p>

                Passionate to an extreme. I leave no project unfinished and I am dedicated to excellence in everything I do. Competitive in my hobbbies and in my work ethic,
                I will always find the best strategy.
